\section{Evaluation}

% baseline 
Evaluation will be performed against each of these three scenarios.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Run-to-Failure: how will the proposed solution compare if no maintenance is performed?
    \item Preventative: how will the proposed solution compare if PvM is performed (the current process of the plant)?
    \item Other Predictive Methods: how will the proposed solution compare if another PdM solution is performed?
\end{enumerate}

Metrcs for evaluation: downtime (or uptime), cost, and number of failures prevented.
Finally, the algorithm will also be scrunitized by a subject matter expert (SME) in terms of usability and interpretability.

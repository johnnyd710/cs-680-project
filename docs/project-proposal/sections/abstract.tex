The following is a proposal for a graduate research project for the University of Waterloo Computer Science class ``CS 680: Introduction to Machine Learning''.
%in affiliation with ArcelorMittal Dofasco and Bentley Systems.
The goal is to use machine learning to estimate the operating condition of an asset (called the health score).
In particular, the algorithm will be implemented and evaluated on an industrial furnace fan critical to a steel plant.
This will allow operators in the steel mill to monitor the asset schedule efficient maintenance tasks, reducing unnecessary maintenance and unexpected failures.
A proposed solution, using self-organizing maps, is used to provide asset owners with an indication of the health of a particular asset (known as \textit{condition monitoring}).
